### 👨‍💻 Currently Exploring and Learning 🧠 


- 🔍 **Thesis: Denoising 3D TEM Tomography via Advanced Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)**

- 🔬 This captivating research focuses on enhancing the quality of 3D images obtained through TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) tomography. By harnessing the power of advanced neural networks, I'm exploring innovative ways to eliminate noise and enhance details in the resulting images.
